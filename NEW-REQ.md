I want you to add feature to read the mobile sms messages automatically and detect banking and transactional sms to calculate income and expenses monthly. The app should read all sms once during initial installation to cache existing transactional information, and then update with new sms whenever the user opens the app. It should categorize income and expenses based on sms content, allowing users to edit account details and categories manually, as well as add custom income and expenses. The app should also provide detailed monthly expense reports by category, capture budget and nickname settings, and manage regular bills and EMI information with reminders.
